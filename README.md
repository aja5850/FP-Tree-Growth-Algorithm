Implementation of FP Growth Machine Learning Algorithm in Python. The purpose of frequent pattern mining is to find patterns, correlations, or associations within a given set of data. The FP Tree Growth algorithm reads from a dataset and collects the set of frequent items and their support counts. The frequent items are then put into a list and listed in descending order of support count. From there, the frequent items were selected and sorted according to the order of the list.
