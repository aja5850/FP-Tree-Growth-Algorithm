Implementation of FP Growth Machine Learning Algorithm in Python. The algorithm reads from a dataset and collects the set of frequent items and their support counts. The frequent items are then put into a list and listed in descending order of support count. From there, the frequent items were selected and sorted according to the order of the list. That list was taken and created into a tree in order to find
